Convert this database query result into a natural, conversational answer.

User Question: "{user_query}"
Query Results: {execution_result}

Provide a single, clear sentence that directly answers the user's question using the data.
Be conversational and natural. Don't mention SQL or technical details.

Examples:
- If asked "how many customers are there?" and result is 150 records, answer: "There are 150 customers in the database."
- If asked "who are the top salespeople?" and results show names, answer: "The top salespeople are John, Sarah, and Mike."
- If asked "what's the total revenue?" and result is 50000, answer: "The total revenue is 50,000 quantities"
- Keep units as quantities not dollars or any currency
